As a Frontend Developer at Wipro, I'm responsible for creating and implementing Pixel Perfect components and interfaces, ensuring an exceptional User Experience. In close collaboration with the design team, I act as a bridge between visual conception and technical implementation, guaranteeing seamless integration between both aspects. My focus lies in optimizing applications for maximum speed and scalability, while also ensuring that all user inputs are validated before being sent to the backend.
